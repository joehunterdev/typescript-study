A quiz app is a fun and engaging project that tests your TypeScript skills. The app presents users with a series of multiple-choice questions and tracks their score as they progress through the quiz.

To build a quiz app, you'll need to:

Create a pool of questions and answers.
Randomly select questions to display to the user.
Implement a user interface for answering questions and navigating the quiz.
Display the user's score and provide feedback on their performance.
To make this project more challenging, consider adding features like:

A timer to limit how long users have to answer each question.
Support for different quiz categories or difficulty levels.
A leaderboard to track and compare scores.
